# GWUAlgorithms
Functions &amp; HW for my algorithms class

# Steps to run HW1
1. Clone the repo locally or simply download the python file
2. replace values of n with other desired values (if necessary)
3. run the program in your python environment

# Steps to run HW2
1. Clone the repo locally / download python file: project 2
2. replace existing arrays with the one defined in the entrypoint
3. run the script to return missing values
4. optionally adjust sizes of the array to output runtimes that are dependent on the size of the arrays
5. the runtime is used as the experimental values for my empirical analysis
